# Abbas-STL
3D print files used in the Abbas lab

Neuralynx files are uploaded in sets of 6. The stages are designed to be used with the Neuralynx EIB-36-NARROW-PTB. Currently on their website this model is no longer available, having been replaced with https://neuralynx.com/hardware/eib-36-narrow. It will have to be ordered custom with the specification (36 pin 4 guide post) to be used with our stages.
